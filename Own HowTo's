### Do you get the message "In order to continue OpenSubtitles subtitles service you need to Log In"?

## Why!!
Opensubtitles has chosen not to offer their subtitles completely unlimited and obliges users to register. Fortunately, this does not cost anything but a few minutes of your time.

 ## How do I update Opensubtitles again?
 Create an Open Subtitles account at [Create Opensubtitles account](http://bit.ly/ondertiteling-2016) This can be done by computer, smartphone or tablet.
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
<li>Enter a username, email address and password and click register
You will receive an activation email on the filled-in email address where you must click on the confirmation URL</li>

<li>Then your Opensubtitles account is active (free).
Go to System> Settings> Add-ons> My Add-ons> Subtitles> Opensubtitles and click on it.</li>

<li>Then click on Configure.</li>

<li>Enter your username and password (which you just created as Opensubtitles account) and click OK.</li>
